# OldPrinterHacks

This was created because my printer can't print double sided and I don't want to manually compute which lecture slides go on each page. (I hear you saying "just put all even pages on one side and odds on the other" but I like squishing 4 slides onto a page to save trees. Also paper costs money.)
Built using JavaScript on an HTML page because it's simple and simple is good. :)

TO USE: Input the range you want to print and the number of pages per side. The application will generate the front pages and the back pages. Print out the front pages and insert the papers back into your printer but flipped around so it will print on the other side of the paper. Make sure that it is in the correct order (so use the same order as the front pages but printers differ so just do some tests).
